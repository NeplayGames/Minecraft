# Minecraft
This is a simple minecraft clone that I made with unity. You can choose and drag and drop the 3 block to the scene and expand it. To save the file simply click the ESC button.

The camera control works in similar way as the unity engine.

To remove a block simply right click on the block and to add one drag a blog from bottom left.
